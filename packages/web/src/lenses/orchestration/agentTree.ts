 * wf_9bbab5e3-d95 "pr1-core-mcp") that the run-state file's `durationMs`
 * equals `timestamp - startTime` of the FINAL Workflow invocation only. When
 * a run is killed/interrupted and later resumed reusing the same runId, the
 * harness overwrites the state file and `startTime` resets to the resumed
 * invocation's start (`startTime + durationMs === timestamp`, confirmed) —
 * so a resumed run's `durationMs` covers only its last execution segment and
 * can be SHORTER than a single one of its own members' duration (observed:
 * a 275223ms/4m35s run-state value vs. a 22m14s member; the run's full
 * member span across segments was ~45m43s). Member `startedAt`/`endedAt`,
 * by contrast,
 * accumulate across every execution segment regardless of resume, so their
 * span is the only reliable stand-in. The run-state file carries no resume
 * marker (no `resumedFromRunId`), so resumption can't be detected and
 * special-cased instead.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT require every member to have `endedAt`: while a run
 * is still in flight, this covers the members finished so far and grows as
 * more complete. Requiring full coverage (and falling back to the stale
 * run-state value otherwise) would resurrect exactly the contradiction above
 * for any run still running — an in-progress run's stale run-state
 * `durationMs` (or none at all, for a synthesized still-running summary) is
 * a worse answer than a partial member span.
 *
 * Known, accepted trade-off: for a normal, uninterrupted run this slightly
 * UNDERcounts harness overhead before the first member starts and after the
 * last one ends (~9s observed on one 52m47s run) — the header reads a few
 * seconds short rather than risking the resume bug above.

 *    still counts once), then a `WorkflowPhaseHeaderRow` per phase in

 *    `flattenSubagents`, preserving nesting/box-drawing within the phase).
 *    Any member agent whose `workflowPhase` doesn't match a known phase
 *    title (including no phase at all) is appended after the named phases
 *    with no phase header of its own — still inside the run's group.
 *  - Run groups for runs present in `workflowRuns` are appended after every

 *    still in progress (no `workflows/<runId>.json` written yet), so

 *    `subagents`. This branch is what keeps that true even for a stale cached
 *    analysis, or any other gap between the two lists — a member agent must
 *    NEVER silently vanish just because its run has no summary. Orphan groups
