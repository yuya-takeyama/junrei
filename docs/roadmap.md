# Junrei — Roadmap

Status legend: ✅ done / 🚧 in progress / ⬜ planned

## v1 prototype (current)

### M0 — Foundation

- ✅ Research: Claude Code session log format, ccusage cost logic, agent
  observability metric landscape
- ✅ Scope interview & decisions (see [design.md](./design.md))
- ✅ Repo scaffold: pnpm monorepo (core/server/web), TypeScript strict, Biome,
  Vitest, aqua-managed tooling, CI (typecheck + lint + test + build) (#1)

### M1 — Core engine

- ✅ Session discovery (`~/.claude/projects`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` support)
- ✅ Streaming JSONL parser with tolerant schema (unknown types → warnings)
- ✅ Token accounting (dedupe by `message.id`) + cost engine (LiteLLM pricing
  snapshot, tiered >200k, cache 5m/1h)
- ✅ Metrics: context growth, compaction, tool histogram/success, subagent tree
- ✅ Differentiators: repetition detection, error classification, exploration
  profile
- ✅ Unit tests against fixture logs; smoke-tested against real local sessions

### M2 — Server + Web UI

- ✅ Hono server: sessions API (list + detail, mtime-keyed cache), typed
  end-to-end via Hono RPC
- ✅ Session list: project, title, time, turns, tools/errors, agents,
  compactions, tokens, cost
- ✅ Session detail: stat tiles (cost incl. subagent share, cache hit rate),
  context growth chart with compaction markers, tool stats with error
  categories, repetition findings, exploration profile, subagent tree,
  cost by model, first prompt
- ✅ Browser-verified via Claude Code preview loop (real sessions, dark mode)

### M3 — MCP

- ✅ MCP endpoint (`/mcp`, Streamable HTTP via official SDK + @hono/mcp,
  stateless per-request transport) on the same server
- ✅ Tools: `list_sessions`, `get_session_summary`, `get_context_timeline`,
  `find_repetitions`, `get_subagent_tree`, `get_first_prompt`
  (tool stats are part of `get_session_summary`)
- ✅ Verified over Streamable HTTP (initialize / tools/list / tools/call
  against real sessions)

### M4 — Polish

- ⬜ End-to-end verification against real sessions (incl. this project's own)
- ⬜ Docs refreshed; README quick start

## Later (post-v1)

- ⬜ Codex session support (adapter layer in core)
- ⬜ Cross-session aggregates & trends
- ⬜ Export/copy portable summaries (paste into ChatGPT, issues, docs)
- ⬜ Review Skill for agent-driven retrospectives
- ⬜ Desktop packaging (Tauri/Electron)
- ⬜ Live tail / watch mode
