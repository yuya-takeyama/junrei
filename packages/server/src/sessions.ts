 * `sources/codex.ts`) is a richer object with its own `getDetail`/
 * `getTimeline`/`getRecordDetail` methods keyed by that source's own key
 * shape (`ClaudeSessionKey`/`CodexSessionKey`) — those aren't part of this
 * shared interface because, even though both key shapes are now `{id}` alone
 * (see `ClaudeSessionKey`'s doc comment), app.ts already knows statically
 * which source's route it's handling, so it calls each adapter's own typed
 * methods directly rather than through this generic surface.
 *
 * `listItems(max, bounds)` returns AT MOST `max` entries, ordered by
 * `sortMs` desc — the session's start time in epoch ms, falling back to a
 * file-timestamp proxy when the transcript carries no `startedAt`. `max` is
 * a cost bound, not just a truncation: the Claude adapter uses it to skip
 * ANALYZING transcripts that can't make the requested page (the whole point
 * of paginating — the first page no longer parses every session on the
 * machine). `bounds` (see `SessionListBounds`, re-exported above) is a
 * second, independent cost bound on the same axis: a date filter narrows
 * which sessions are eligible at all, so the Claude adapter also uses it to
 * skip analysis for refs outside the window (see `claudeListItems`) — the
 * mechanism that makes a 7-day default list view cheap even when `max` alone
 * wouldn't have excluded an old session. `total` is the source's full
 * listable-session count regardless of `max`/`bounds`, so pagination can be
 * sized without analyzing everything.
